## Accessing your Sysdig environment

You'll have received a login and password for Sysdig from the facilitator. To sign into your environment:

1. Open a web browser and go to <https://sysdig.com>
2. Under the Log In dropdown on the top right of the page choose ["YOUR_SYSDIG_ACCOUNT_REGION section"](#know-your-sysdig-region) (US-East, EU-Central, ...) under **Sysdig Secure** (NOTE: not Sysdig Monitor which we won't be looking at today)
    1. !["sysdiglogin"]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/sysdiglogin.png)
3. Enter the email address and password you were provided for Sysdig and click the **Log in** button
4. If you see the Customize your Sysdig experience screen, then click the **Get into Sysdig** button in the lower right hand corner to take you through to the **Home** screen
